# etherscrap

Scrap contract files from Etherscan.

## Usage

Run `./scrap.sh <address>`

where `<address>` is the address of the contract you want to scrap.

Be wary that this command will create new directories where you call it, placing the contracts inside it.

Notice also that you should pass the address of the implementation contract.
